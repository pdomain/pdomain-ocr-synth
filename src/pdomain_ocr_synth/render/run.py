"""End-to-end render orchestration for recognition + detection (M07/M09).

``run_recipe`` ties M03-M06 together into the trainer-consumable
profile layout described in :mod:`pdomain_ocr_synth.output`:

1. Run corpus providers + recipe-level text transforms.
2. Tokenize for the recipe's layout mode.
3. Pick ``count`` deterministic samples.
4. Render + degrade each sample, streaming results into the writer
   that matches ``output.mode`` (recognition or detection).
5. Honor ``--force`` / ``--resume`` semantics, including snapshot
   integrity checks.

Layouts wired in:

- ``recognition`` + ``word_crops`` (M07) — one word per sample.
- ``recognition`` + ``lines`` (M09) — one line per sample, with
  per-word bboxes carried through the manifest.
- ``detection`` + ``paragraphs`` (M09) — multi-line paragraph per
  sample, with per-line + per-word bboxes carried into ``labels.json``.
- ``detection`` + ``pages`` (M09) — multi-paragraph page per sample,
  with per-paragraph + per-line + per-word bboxes; per-line GT lands
  in ``labels.json`` (the writer flattens lines across paragraphs in
  reading order).

Paragraph input shape: tokenization yields one paragraph per sample
(blank-line-separated). ``render_paragraph`` requires a pre-fitted
``list[str]`` of lines, which we produce in one of two ways:

- ``layout.max_width_px`` is set → the wrap-fitter
  (:func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.wrap.fit_lines`) shapes each candidate
  line against the paragraph's pre-sampled font + pixel size and
  greedy-packs words into lines that fit. Hard newlines in the
  corpus token are preserved as line breaks. To keep the wrap budget
  aligned with what the renderer paints, we pre-sample a
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.paragraph.ParagraphStyle` and thread
  it through both ``fit_lines`` and ``render_paragraph``.
- ``layout.max_width_px`` is not set → split on embedded newlines
  only (after a ``str.splitlines`` + empty-line filter). A
  paragraph with no embedded newlines becomes a single-line
  paragraph, still a legal detection-mode sample because
  ``DetectionWriter`` only requires per-line + per-word ground truth,
  not multiple lines.

Page input shape: tokenization for ``pages`` mode yields one
**page-sized** chunk per sample, where paragraphs inside a page are
separated by a blank line (a run of 2+ newlines) and pages are
separated by a **triple**-blank-line boundary (a run of 3+ newlines).
The pages splitter inside ``_render_sample`` re-splits the page
token on the paragraph boundary and then runs the same per-paragraph
wrap path as ``paragraphs`` mode (each paragraph wraps independently
against ``layout.max_width_px``). The page-level ``PageStyle`` is
pre-sampled once so wrap-fitting measures against the same font +
pixel size the renderer paints with — same seam as paragraphs mode,
lifted to the page level.

Determinism is the same as :mod:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.preview`: the
per-token pick is keyed on ``seed ^ 0xC0FFEE``; per-sample render +
degradation RNGs are reseeded by sample index. Worker count is not
load-bearing on output bytes.
