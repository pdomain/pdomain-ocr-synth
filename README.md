# pd-ocr-synth

Synthetic OCR training-data generator. Produces labeled image+text pairs for
historical and specialty typography (first target: Cló Gaelach / early Irish
typography), in the format consumed by `pd-ocr-trainer` profiles.

**Status:** M00–M10 substantially shipped. M11 (preview UI) and M12 (glyph annotations) remain.
The `docs/specs/` set is the authoritative design reference; `docs/plans/` tracks milestone progress.

## Why

Real labeled data for historical scripts is scarce. The standard playbook for
training an OCR model on uncommon typography is:

1. Generate a large synthetic corpus (this project)
2. Pretrain on it
3. Fine-tune on a small set of real labeled pages from `pd-ocr-labeler`

This project covers step 1. It is recipe-driven so adding a new script
(Fraktur, blackletter, early-modern English with long-s, Greek, etc.) is a
matter of writing a YAML file plus optional custom transforms.

## How it fits the workspace

```
[ pd-ocr-synth ]  →  recognition crops + detection pages
        │
        ▼
[ pd-ocr-trainer ]  reads new profile (e.g. `gaelic`)
        │
        ▼
[ pd-ocr-cli ]  uses fine-tuned model on real scans
```

The output adapter writes directly into the directory layout
`pd-ocr-trainer` already understands.
