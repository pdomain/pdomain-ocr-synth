"""Per-render audit log (M10 stretch).

Each ``run_recipe`` invocation appends one JSONL line to a per-output
audit file at ``<output_dir>/_audit.jsonl`` so a downstream consumer
of a rendered dataset can trace it back to the recipe + seed + runtime
that produced it. Useful when:

- a model trained from a specific dataset version is later debugged
  ("which recipe was this trained on?");
- two render runs produced suspiciously different outputs and you
  want to diff their seeds / SHAs;
- a corrupted dataset needs the original render's wall-time to match
  it against logs from other tools.

The format is intentionally append-only JSONL — one render → one line
— so concurrent runs into the same destination (uncommon, but legal
during ``--resume``) don't clobber each other and a tail-friendly
text-format means ``less`` / ``jq`` work without extra tooling.

## What lands in each entry

- ``timestamp``: ISO-8601 UTC string at the moment the entry is
  finalized (post-render).
- ``recipe_name``: ``recipe.name`` (free-text identifier).
- ``recipe_sha``: SHA-256 of the recipe source file bytes when
  ``recipe.source_path`` is set, else ``None``. We hash the on-disk
  YAML so a recipe that was edited mid-run is captured at its
  rendered-version snapshot. (The publish step uses a separate
  ``content_sha`` over the staging dir; that one is dataset-bytes-
  invariant. The render audit is recipe-bytes-invariant.)
- ``output_dir``: absolute path the writer wrote into.
- ``count``: effective sample count (post ``--count`` override).
- ``seed``: effective seed (post ``--seed`` override).
- ``workers``: worker pool size as the runner saw it (the
  resolution-from-flags step happens earlier in the CLI).
- ``rendered`` / ``skipped``: counts from the ``RunResult``.
- ``runtime_seconds``: wall time as the writer's stats recorded it.
- ``schema_version``: ``1`` — bumps on shape changes so a future
  reader can branch.

## Disabling

- Pass ``audit=False`` to the public ``append_audit_entry`` /
  ``write_audit_for_run`` calls.
- Set the env var ``PD_OCR_SYNTH_NO_AUDIT=1`` in the environment to
  globally suppress audit emission. Useful in tests / sensitive runs
  where filesystem state must be reproducible byte-for-byte without
  the timestamped audit drift.

## Determinism note

The ``timestamp`` field is wall-clock and therefore non-deterministic
across runs. A test that asserts byte-for-byte equality on the audit
file should either freeze time or assert on the parsed-back JSON
shape — see ``tests/test_audit.py`` for the parse-back pattern.

## Concurrent writes

The global aggregate at ``<cache_root>/audit.jsonl`` (see
:func:`default_global_audit_path`) can be written-to by two parallel
``run_recipe`` invocations from independent CLI processes. We rely
on the POSIX guarantee that ``write(2)`` calls smaller than
``PIPE_BUF`` (4096 bytes on Linux) on a file opened with ``O_APPEND``
are atomic and ordered — Python's ``open(path, "a", encoding="utf-8")``
maps to ``O_APPEND`` on POSIX, and the buffered writer flushes one
serialized JSONL line + newline as a single underlying ``write``. A
typical audit line is a few hundred bytes (timestamp + identity +
counts + a single ``output_dir`` path bounded by ``PATH_MAX``); even
a pathological deep ``output_dir`` stays under 4 KB.

Caveats this assumption does *not* cover:

- **Non-POSIX filesystems** (Windows native, NFS without
  ``actimeo=0``): ``O_APPEND`` atomicity is not guaranteed. Mixed
  lines on a shared NFS-backed cache root are possible. Operators
  who run pdomain-ocr-synth across multiple hosts pointed at one shared
  ``$PD_OCR_SYNTH_CACHE`` should set ``PD_OCR_SYNTH_NO_GLOBAL_AUDIT=1``
  on all but one host (or accept the risk and grep ``jq -c .`` over
  the file, which skips malformed lines).
- **Lines exceeding ``PIPE_BUF``** (very long ``output_dir``
  strings): theoretically possible but bounded by ``PATH_MAX`` (4096
  on Linux) which gives roughly the same budget as ``PIPE_BUF``.
  Documented here so a future schema bump that adds a large field
  forces this comment to be re-evaluated.
- **In-process concurrency**: ``run_recipe`` writes the audit row
  exactly once at the end of a render, after the worker pool has
  joined. No same-process race.

Reader-side: :func:`read_audit_entries` calls ``json.loads`` per line
and raises ``JSONDecodeError`` on malformed JSON. A torn line from
the rare cross-host NFS case would surface loudly rather than being
silently dropped — preferred since silently dropping rows from a
forensic log is worse than a noisy parse error.

    Rows whose ``schema_version`` does not equal
    :data:`AUDIT_SCHEMA_VERSION` are dropped from the returned list and
    an :class:`AuditSchemaVersionWarning` is emitted naming the
    encountered version. Rationale:

    - A v1 reader cannot trust v2 field semantics (a future bump might
      rename ``count`` to ``planned_count`` or change ``runtime_seconds``
      from float-seconds to integer-milliseconds). Surfacing a v2 row to
      a CLI summary that sums ``runtime_seconds`` would silently produce
      wrong totals.
    - A v2 reader (future code) can apply the same skip-with-warning
      policy to v1 rows symmetrically — a mixed-version audit file
      remains usable from either side, with each reader returning only
      the rows it can interpret faithfully.
    - Skipping (vs raising) lets ``audit --summary`` keep working in a
      mixed-version environment: the user gets a warning that some rows
      were ignored, and the summary covers what's understood.

    Rows missing ``schema_version`` entirely are treated as legacy v1
    (the field was introduced in v1, so absence implies pre-versioning
    or hand-edited input — best-effort interpret as v1). This keeps
    ``echo '{"recipe_name": "x"}' > _audit.jsonl`` style minimal test
    fixtures working.
