"""YAML loader for recipe files.

Steps performed by :func:`load_recipe`:

1. Read the YAML file with ``yaml.safe_load``.
2. Resolve path-bearing keys (``~``, ``${ENV_VAR}``, relative-to-recipe)
   via :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.recipe.paths.resolve_paths`.
3. Validate against the pydantic models in
   :mod:`pdomain_ocr_synth.recipe.models` and return a frozen ``Recipe``.

Errors at steps 1-2 raise :class:`RecipeLoadError`; errors at step 3
propagate as :class:`pydantic.ValidationError` so callers can format the
location info themselves (the CLI ``validate`` subcommand does this).

    - ``- preset: <name>`` expands to the list of stages declared
      under ``degradation_presets[<name>]``, in order, at the
      reference site.
    - Presets are local to one recipe (no cross-recipe lookup).
    - Presets cannot reference other presets — the expansion is a
      single pass, not recursive. This keeps the spec tractable and
      prevents accidental cycles.
    - Unknown preset names raise ``RecipeLoadError`` so the user gets
      a load-time failure instead of silently dropping stages.
