"""Pre-flight checks against a built HF staging directory.

Per ``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md`` § Dataset card and the matching
deliverable in ``docs/roadmap/08-publishing-hf.md``, the README that
ships in the staging dir must carry a fixed set of conventional
``pdomain-ocr-*`` front-matter keys:

- ``pdomain-ocr-shape`` — fixed shape label, e.g. ``recognition/v1``.
- ``pdomain-ocr-source`` — producer tool name; always ``pdomain-ocr-synth``.
- ``pdomain-ocr-recipe-sha`` — SHA over the snapshot YAML bytes.
- ``pdomain-ocr-render-tool-version`` — tool version that produced the
  output, copied from the snapshot.
- ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` — SHA over the staging-dir contents,
  written into the front matter by ``apply_content_sha_to_readme``.

The staging builder (`recognition.build_recognition_staging`) populates
these in two passes: the dataset-card writer fills in the first four
from the local snapshot, and ``apply_content_sha_to_readme`` rewrites
the README to add ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` once the rest of the dir has
settled. The risk this module guards against is a *silently dropped*
key — if the snapshot is missing a ``tool_version`` field the
``pdomain-ocr-render-tool-version`` line never gets written, and the
upload flow produces a card the trainer can't pin against.

Why a separate module rather than inline checks in ``recognition``:

- The pre-flight is the natural last step before contacting HF, and
  the upcoming ``--dry-run`` chunk + the eventual upload step both
  want to invoke it. Hoisting it here keeps the call-site short and
  testable in isolation.
- The check is *read-only* over the staging dir — no mutation, no
  network. That isolation is important: a future detection-mode
  staging path (M09) will share the same required-key contract and
  will reuse this validator unchanged.

This module is deliberately **pure file-IO** — it does not import
``huggingface_hub`` and never reads the network. It assumes the
staging dir was produced by ``build_recognition_staging`` (or a
future detection-mode equivalent) so the README path and front-matter
syntax are known.

        triggers a pre-flight failure).
    missing_keys:
        Required keys that are absent from the front matter entirely.
        Stable order, matching :data:`REQUIRED_FRONT_MATTER_KEYS`.
    empty_keys:
        Required keys that are *present* but resolve to an empty /
        whitespace-only value. Treated as just-as-bad as missing
        because HF lint and the trainer's pin-by-key both fail on

    Parses ``<staging_dir>/README.md``'s YAML front matter and checks
    that every key in ``required`` is present and resolves to a
    non-empty value. Returns a :class:`PreflightReport` either way; the

    Parameters
    ----------
    staging_dir:
        Built staging dir produced by

    required:
        Override the required-keys set. Defaults to

        ``check_required_front_matter(staging, required=...)`` calls
        that run *before* ``apply_content_sha_to_readme`` (and so don't

    Returns
    -------
    PreflightReport
        The parse outcome plus any missing / empty keys. Use the
        ``ok`` property as the single boolean check; use the lists
        for actionable error messages.

    Raises
    ------
    PreflightError
        If the README is missing or unparseable. Missing required
        *keys* do **not** raise — they're returned in the report so
        the caller can format a structured error or list everything
        wrong at once. (Distinguishing "broken README" from "missing
        keys" matters: the first is a bug in our writer, the second
        is a bug in the inputs.)
