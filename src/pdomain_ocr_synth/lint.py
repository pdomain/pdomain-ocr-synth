"""Recipe linter — heuristic checks beyond schema validation.

Per ``docs/roadmap/10-stretch.md`` § Quality-of-life follow-ups:

    Recipe linter. Beyond schema validation, flag suspicious patterns:
    degradation always at probability 1.0, single font, no text
    transforms when the corpus is in modern spelling.

These are *style* issues — a recipe that flunks every lint check still
renders correctly. Lint output is therefore purely advisory: every
issue surfaced here uses ``severity="warning"``. Hard errors live in
:mod:`pdomain_ocr_synth.validation`.

The CLI :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.cli._cmd_lint` runs full schema validation
first and only then layers lint on top, so a malformed recipe never
reaches this module.
