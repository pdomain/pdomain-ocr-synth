"""Unit tests for ``pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.idempotency`` (M08).

Covers the three-step procedure from ``docs/specs/10-publishing.md``
§ Idempotency:

1. (Caller-supplied) compute local content SHA.
2. Read remote ``card_data.pdomain-ocr-content-sha``.
3. If equal → no-op; otherwise → upload.

We drive every test against :class:`FakeTransport` so the suite stays
network-free. The fake's ``seed_repo`` lets us model "the repo already
has a published commit with content-SHA X" so the up-to-date branch is
exercisable without first running an upload — but we also exercise the
post-upload round-trip path where ``upload_folder`` refreshes
``card_data`` from the staged README, because that's the real-world
shape the runner will hit on a re-run.
