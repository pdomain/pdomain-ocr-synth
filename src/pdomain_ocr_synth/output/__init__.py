"""Output writers — turn rendered samples into trainer-consumable layouts.

Recognition mode (M07) writes the ``pd-ocr-trainer/v1`` recognition
profile: ``images/<NAME>.png`` + ``labels.json`` + ``manifest.jsonl`` +
``recipe.snapshot.yaml`` + ``stats.json``.

Detection mode (M09) writes the parallel detection profile:
``images/page_<NAME>.png`` + ``labels.json`` (with per-line polygons +
rich GT) + the same manifest/snapshot/stats sidecars. The detection
writer is scaffolding only as of M09 — it is exposed here so tests
and future paragraph/page dispatch can drive it directly, but
``run_recipe`` does not yet route to it.
