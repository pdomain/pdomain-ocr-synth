"""Concrete :class:`HfTransport` adapter wrapping ``huggingface_hub`` (M08).

This module is the **only** file in ``pdomain_ocr_synth`` that imports
``huggingface_hub``. Every other publish module — orchestrator, CLI
runner, idempotency check, dataset card, content SHA — drives against
the :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.HfTransport` Protocol so
they remain unit-testable without the SDK and without the network.

The adapter is a thin translator: each Protocol method forwards to the
corresponding ``HfApi`` call documented in ``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md``
§ Tooling used. The mapping is:

============================  ==============================================
Protocol method               ``HfApi`` call
============================  ==============================================
``repo_exists``               ``repo_exists(repo_id, repo_type='dataset')``
``create_repo``               ``create_repo(repo_id, repo_type='dataset',
                              private=..., exist_ok=...)``
``read_remote_card_data``     ``dataset_info(repo_id, revision=...)``
                              then ``.card_data`` → ``dict``
``upload_folder``             ``upload_large_folder(repo_id,
                              folder_path=str(p), repo_type='dataset',
                              revision=...)`` then
                              ``list_repo_commits(...)`` for the SHA
``create_tag``                ``create_tag(repo_id, repo_type='dataset',
                              tag=..., revision=...,
                              tag_message=message)``
============================  ==============================================

Why ``upload_large_folder`` rather than ``upload_folder``: spec 10
§ Tooling used mandates the resumable variant. The trade-off is that
``upload_large_folder`` does not accept a ``commit_message`` at all
(per its huggingface_hub 1.13 signature and docstring); the chunked
uploads use HF's auto-generated messages. The CLI surfaces this with
a stderr warning when the user passes ``--message`` — see
``cli_runner.py`` ``_MESSAGE_LIMITATION_WARNING`` and
``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md`` § Tooling used → Known limitation.
The Protocol still accepts ``commit_message`` so the orchestrator
keeps a single message-formation site and so a future detection-mode
``push_to_hub`` path can honor it. Recovering the latest commit SHA
after upload is done via ``HfApi.list_repo_commits(...)[0]``; if that
probe fails we fall back to an empty SHA rather than failing the
whole publish — the upload itself succeeded by then and surfacing a
misleading TransportError would mask a genuine success.

Error wrapping: every ``huggingface_hub`` exception is repackaged as
:class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.TransportError`. Tests assert
on the wrapping rather than on the SDK-specific class so the
contract is stable across SDK versions.

    """Production transport satisfying :class:`HfTransport`.

    Constructed once per CLI invocation by
    :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.sdk_transport.make_default_transport`.
    The constructor builds an internal ``HfApi`` and threads the token
    through so per-call ``token=`` plumbing isn't needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    token:
        The resolved HF token (per spec 10 § Authentication). Used for
        every authenticated call. ``HfApi`` itself accepts ``None`` and
        falls back to ``HfFolder``-cached creds, but we never want that
        ambiguity here — auth resolution is the CLI runner's job and
        the resolved token is what the adapter must use.
    api:
        Test seam. When ``None`` (the production default) the
        constructor builds ``HfApi(token=token, library_name=...)``.
        Tests inject a ``unittest.mock.Mock(spec=HfApi)`` so they can
        assert on call arguments and program return values without a
        real network. Library name is set so HF's own logging /
        analytics distinguishes our calls — purely cosmetic but cheap.

        The ``commit_message`` parameter cannot be honored by
