"""Drift guard: ``docs/specs/recipe.schema.json`` ↔ pydantic ``Recipe`` model.

The JSON schema artifact at ``docs/specs/recipe.schema.json`` is generated
by ``make schema`` (which invokes ``pdomain-ocr-synth schema -o ...``) from
``Recipe.model_json_schema()``. There is no automatic hook that runs the
regen, so a contributor can land a Recipe-model field change without
remembering to refresh the artifact — leaving the published JSON-Schema
contract out of sync with the code.

This test fails CI when that happens. It re-runs the exact same regen
the ``schema`` CLI command does (in-process, no subprocess) and compares
byte-for-byte to the checked-in artifact. On drift it tells the
contributor exactly which command to run to fix it.

Iter 69 (commit ``c762238``) ad-hoc verified byte-identity once; this
test locks the contract permanently.
