"""Upload orchestration for ``pdomain-ocr-synth publish`` (M08).

This module ties the leaf primitives that already shipped — staging
build, content-SHA, preflight, idempotency check, transport — into the
single end-to-end upload call the CLI runner will dispatch to once the
real-upload path replaces the current "use --dry-run" stub.

Per ``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md`` the upload sequence is, in order:

1. **Pre-flight** the staging dir (already built upstream by
   :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.recognition.build_recognition_staging`):
   the README must carry the documented ``pdomain-ocr-*`` keys including
   the freshly-embedded ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha``.
2. **Compute the local content SHA** from the staging dir. For a
   staging dir built by :func:`build_recognition_staging` the digest
   is already pinned in the README, so we recompute over the
   strip-then-rehash version (the ``compute_content_sha`` helper does
   the strip itself) — recomputing rather than parsing keeps this
   path resilient to a hand-edited README and matches the contract
   the idempotency check uses.
3. **Idempotency check** against the transport. If the repo already
   carries our digest in ``card_data.pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` the publish
   is a no-op and we return early with state ``"no_change"``. Spec 10
   § Idempotency: "If equal → exit 0 with 'no changes' and do not
   commit."
4. **Create the repo** if it doesn't exist yet, unless ``allow_create``
   is False. Spec 10 § Errors and recovery: "Repo doesn't exist →
   Auto-create unless ``--no-create``." When ``allow_create`` is
   False on a missing repo we raise :class:`PublishError` with state
   ``"repo_missing"`` so the CLI runner can map it to the documented
   exit-7 publish failure.
5. **Upload** the staging folder via :meth:`HfTransport.upload_folder`.
   The transport returns a :class:`CommitInfo` we surface verbatim.
6. **Optionally tag** the resulting commit when ``tag`` is supplied.
   Spec 10 § Versioning: "Each publish creates one commit. Tag it
   explicitly when you want a pin." The tag is created *after* a
   successful upload, never before — a tag pointing at a missing /
   half-uploaded commit would be worse than no tag at all.

The orchestrator is pure :class:`HfTransport` orchestration: every
network-shaped operation flows through the Protocol. There is **no
``huggingface_hub`` import here** and tests drive against
:class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.FakeTransport`. The concrete
SDK-backed transport adapter lands in a later chunk and is the only
file that imports the SDK.

## Why ``PublishResult`` instead of "just the commit SHA"

The CLI runner needs to print a different message for each terminal
state (no-change, created-and-uploaded, plain-upload, tagged) and the
``DATASETS.md``-style operator log wants the digest + URL too. A
single dataclass keeps every call site reading from the same object
rather than passing positional tuples around.

## Why a separate ``allow_create`` flag instead of inferring from CLI

The CLI parses ``--no-create`` into a boolean; threading the flag
through verbatim keeps the orchestrator agnostic of how the user
toggled it. A future programmatic caller (e.g. a Python notebook
publishing without the CLI) gets the same default ``allow_create=True``
that matches the spec's documented "auto-create unless ``--no-create``"
behavior.

## What this module does *not* do

- It does **not** build the staging dir. The caller must have already
  run :func:`build_recognition_staging` (or equivalent) so the
  staging dir on disk is upload-ready.
- It does **not** resolve the HF token. Token resolution lives in
  :mod:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.auth` and is the CLI runner's
  responsibility *before* dispatching to this orchestrator. Once
  resolved, the token is wired into the transport at construction
  time, not threaded through here.
- It does **not** map exit codes. The CLI runner translates
  :class:`PublishError` (and any propagated
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.TransportError` /
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.preflight.PreflightError` /
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.content_sha.ContentShaError`) onto
  spec 01's exit codes. Embedding exit codes here would couple this
  leaf module to the CLI dispatcher.
- It does **not** decide what to upload. The staging dir on disk
  *is* the contract: every regular file under it goes up, the
  preflight has already verified the layout, and the orchestrator
  does not second-guess that decision.

    Members
    -------
    NO_CHANGE:
        Idempotency check found a matching ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` on
        the remote. No ``upload_folder`` happened. The runner exits 0
        with the spec's "no changes" message.
    CREATED:
        The repo did not exist; the orchestrator created it *and*
        uploaded. ``commit_sha`` carries the first commit's SHA. The
        runner prints both "created repo" and "uploaded" lines.
    UPLOADED:
        The repo already existed and the local content differed; we
        uploaded and got back a new commit. Most-common branch on a
        re-publish that has actual changes.
    """

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class PublishResult:
    """What :func:`publish_recognition` did, end to end.

    Frozen so the runner can log without worrying about downstream
    mutation; ``slots=True`` keeps it cheap for the inevitable case
    where a single CLI invocation builds many of these (e.g. a future
    multi-recipe publish loop).

    Attributes
    ----------
    state:
        See :class:`PublishState`. Drives the runner's branch on
        which "would you like fries with that" log line to print.
    repo_id:
        Echoed verbatim. Useful for log aggregation that wants to
        match the result to its originating publish call.
    content_sha:
        The digest the orchestrator computed locally. On the
        ``NO_CHANGE`` branch this equals the remote's
        ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` by construction.
    commit_sha:
        The 40-char SHA of the upload commit, or empty string if no
        upload happened (``NO_CHANGE``). Tests treat empty-string as
        the "no commit" sentinel.
    commit_url:
        Human-clickable URL the transport returned, or empty string.
        The CLI runner falls back to a synthesized
        ``hf.co/datasets/<repo>/commit/<sha>`` link when this is
        empty so users always get *some* link.
    tag:
        The tag created against the upload commit, or ``None`` if no
        ``tag`` was passed. Echoed so the runner can include it in
        the success line without re-reading the call args.

    Implements the spec's upload sequence end-to-end:

    ``upload_folder`` → maybe ``create_tag``.

    The function is **pure transport orchestration** — every
    network-shaped operation flows through the
    :class:`HfTransport` Protocol, and tests drive the whole flow
    against :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.FakeTransport`. No
    ``huggingface_hub`` import.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transport:
        Anything satisfying :class:`HfTransport`. In production this
        will be the SDK-backed adapter; in tests it's
        :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.FakeTransport`.
    repo_id:
        Canonical ``OWNER/NAME``. Repo-id validation is not the
        orchestrator's job — the CLI runner / a future small chunk
        owns that. Passing a malformed value here will surface the
        SDK's own error via :class:`TransportError`.
    staging_dir:
        Already-built staging directory (per
        :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.recognition.build_recognition_staging`).
        Must exist and pass :func:`assert_staging_publish_ready`.
    commit_message:
        The commit message for the upload commit. The caller
        supplies a fully-formatted string — the spec's default
        format (``pdomain-ocr-synth render @<recipe-sha>``) is built
        elsewhere; this function just forwards it. ``--message
        <override>`` from spec 10 plumbs through unchanged.
    private:
        Visibility for newly-created repos. Ignored when the repo
        already exists (HF's :meth:`create_repo` honors
        ``exist_ok=True`` by leaving the existing visibility alone;
        that's the right default for a publish step that should
        never silently flip a public repo to private).
    allow_create:
        When True (the default, matching spec 10's "auto-create
        unless ``--no-create``"), a missing repo is created before
        upload. When False, a missing repo raises
        :class:`PublishError` so the CLI runner can map it to exit 7.
    tag:
        Optional version tag (per spec 10 § Versioning). Created
        *after* a successful upload; never against a missing or
        half-finished commit. ``None`` skips tag creation.

    Returns
    -------
    PublishResult
        Structured terminal state + artifacts. The runner prints a
        per-state log line and exits 0.

    Raises
    ------
    pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.preflight.PreflightError
        Staging dir is structurally invalid (missing README, missing
        ``pdomain-ocr-*`` keys, etc). The runner maps this to exit 6.
    pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.content_sha.ContentShaError
        Could not hash the staging dir.
    PublishError
        ``allow_create=False`` and the repo doesn't exist.
    pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.transport.TransportError
        Any transport-level failure (network, auth, conflict). The
        runner maps this to exit 7. We do not catch / repackage
        TransportError here — keeping it in flight preserves the
        original error message for the user.
