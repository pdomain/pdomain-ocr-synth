"""CLI orchestration for ``pdomain-ocr-synth publish`` (M08).

This module is the glue between the argparse-built CLI surface in
``pdomain_ocr_synth.cli`` and the publish primitives that already exist
(staging build, preflight, summary, content-SHA, token resolver,
upload orchestrator). The split keeps ``cli.py`` short and lets each
flow (dry-run preview, real upload) be exercised in isolation by
tests that don't need to round-trip through ``main()``.

Per ``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md`` and ``docs/roadmap/08-publishing-hf.md``:

- ``publish --dry-run`` shows what would be uploaded **without
  contacting HF**: target repo, file count, total size, dataset-card
  preview, content SHA. No ``huggingface_hub`` import; no network.
- Auth resolution attempts are reported by *source label only*
  ("flag", "env", "cache") — the token value is never echoed. A
  missing token is **not** fatal in dry-run mode (you can preview
  without credentials), only in real upload mode where the orchestrator
  needs a transport.
- Real upload (no ``--dry-run``) calls
  :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.publish_recognition` against the
  transport produced by ``transport_factory`` (default
  :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.make_default_transport`). The factory
  is *injectable* so tests substitute a
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.FakeTransport` and the production CLI
  default lazy-imports ``huggingface_hub``. Until the SDK adapter
  lands, the production factory raises
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.SdkUnavailableError`, which is a
  :class:`pdomain_ocr_synth.publish.TransportError` and therefore maps to
  the documented exit-7 publish failure.
- ``--render-first`` (spec 10 § When to publish) chains a render
  step in front of the publish pipeline so a single command produces
  the local layout AND ships it. The render callable is *injectable*
  so tests don't pay the real-rendering cost; the production default
  delegates to :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.run_recipe`. Render failure
  short-circuits with exit 5 (the spec-01 RENDER_EXIT), distinct from
  publish-family failures (exit 7).

Dry-run remains the first user-visible publish surface: it exercises
every primitive that landed in earlier chunks end-to-end, gives users
a pre-flight they can run before committing to an upload, and makes
the format-conversion work auditable without an HF token.

The temp-staging strategy is shared by both modes — we never write
into ``recipe.output.destination``'s parent (which would be
presumptuous) and the temp dir is auto-cleaned. The cost is that the
staging build runs each time; that's deliberate — the SHA depends on
the staging contents, so reusing a stale staging dir would lie about
the digest.

    local_output_dir:

        "public", ``None`` → "public" (spec default for synth).
    flag_token:

        ("flag" / "env" / "cache") without echoing the secret.
    license_override:
        Value of the ``--license`` CLI flag, or ``None``. Forwarded

        preview reflects the same license the real upload will stamp.

    onto the keyword params here so this function is the single place

    Parameters
    ----------
    recipe_arg, repo_flag, private, public, token_flag, output_override, dry_run:
        Direct passthroughs from the argparse layer; see spec 01's
        ``publish`` section for semantics.
    no_create:
        Spec 10 § Errors and recovery: ``--no-create`` flips
        ``allow_create=False`` on the orchestrator. A missing repo
        then fails with exit 7 instead of being auto-created.
    tag:
        Spec 10 § Versioning: optional version tag created against
        the upload commit.
    message:
        Spec 10 § Versioning: ``--message <MSG>`` overrides the
        auto-generated commit message. ``None`` falls back to the
        ``pdomain-ocr-synth render @<recipe-sha>`` default.
    license_override:
        Spec 10 § Recipe ``publish:`` block: ``--license <LICENSE>``
        overrides ``recipe.publish.hf_dataset.license`` in the staged
        dataset card's front matter. ``None`` falls back to the
        recipe value (or omits the key entirely).
    render_first:
        Spec 10 § When to publish: ``--render-first`` chains a render
        step in front of the publish pipeline, equivalent to running
        ``pdomain-ocr-synth render <recipe>`` first. Errors from the
        render step short-circuit with exit 5 (RENDER_EXIT) — the
        publish pipeline never runs. Compatible with ``--dry-run``:
        rendering happens, then the dry-run preview is generated
        against the freshly-rendered output.
    transport_factory:
        Production callers leave this ``None`` to get the default
        :func:`make_default_transport` (which currently raises
        :class:`SdkUnavailableError` until the adapter lands; that
        error is a :class:`TransportError` and maps to exit 7). Tests
        inject a fake-returning factory to drive the full upload path
        hermetically.
    render_first_callable:
        Production callers leave this ``None`` to get
        :func:`_default_render_first` (which delegates to
        :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.run_recipe`). Tests inject a
        no-op or recording stub so they don't pay the real-rendering
        cost; only the chaining contract is exercised.

    Loads the recipe at ``recipe_path``, then calls
    :func:`pdomain_ocr_synth.render.run_recipe` with the resolved
    ``output_dir`` (matches what the publish pipeline will read).

    Recipe-level overrides (count / seed / workers) are intentionally
    **not** plumbed here: spec 10 § When to publish describes
    ``--render-first`` as "render before publishing", i.e. run the
    recipe as-written. Users who want to render a smoke-sized subset
    should invoke ``render -c N`` separately and then plain
    ``publish`` — that way the chained form remains "ship a real
    recipe-shaped dataset" rather than an under-specified shorthand.

    Failures bubble up as their native exception types
    (:class:`RenderError`, :class:`DestinationNotEmptyError`,
    :class:`SnapshotMismatchError`); the CLI runner's broad
    ``except Exception`` catch in :func:`cmd_publish` maps them all to
    RENDER_EXIT.

    Implementation note on idempotency: the publish pipeline expects
    the destination to *already exist* (that's the whole reason
    ``--render-first`` is needed). On a re-run with this flag we
    therefore pass ``force=True`` so the render step can clear the
    destination and write fresh — otherwise the existing render's
    "non-empty destination" guard would refuse and exit 6, which would
    be surprising for someone who just asked us to chain render +
    publish.
