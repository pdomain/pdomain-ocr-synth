"""Hugging Face token resolution for ``pdomain-ocr-synth publish``.

Per ``docs/specs/10-publishing.md`` § Authentication and the matching
deliverable in ``docs/roadmap/08-publishing-hf.md``:

> Order: ``--token`` flag → ``HF_TOKEN`` env →
> ``~/.cache/huggingface/token``. Clear error message naming the
> resolution chain on failure.

This module implements *only* the resolution + error-formatting half
of auth. It deliberately does **not** import ``huggingface_hub``: the
helper is called early in the publish flow (often before any network
work) and we want token discovery to work in environments where the
SDK isn't installed yet — and to stay testable without it. The token
string is then handed to ``HfApi(token=...)`` by the upload-time code
that lands later in M08.

The exit-code mapping (publish-time auth failure → exit 7) is covered
by the CLI surface, which lands in a later chunk; the helper here only
raises a typed exception. Keeping the exception layer narrow means a
future ``--dry-run`` path can recover from "no token" without ever
touching the SDK.

## Why a fresh helper rather than ``huggingface_hub.HfFolder``

``huggingface_hub`` ships its own resolver
(``HfFolder.get_token`` / ``get_token``) that is *almost* what we want
but differs in two ways the spec calls out:

1. We want the ``--token`` CLI flag to take priority over the env
   var, which the SDK doesn't model — its resolver only sees the
   env + cached file.
2. The error message must name *all three* resolution steps so the
   user knows what to set. The SDK raises a generic "no token" with
   no actionable suggestions.

Rather than wrap the SDK and patch around those gaps, we own the
resolution chain explicitly. The SDK still runs at upload time with
the resolved token string.

    Attributes
    ----------
    token:
        The resolved token string. Treat as a secret — do not log or
        echo. Pass directly to ``HfApi(token=...)``.
    source:
        Human-readable label of the resolution step that produced
        the token. One of ``"flag"``, ``"env"``, or ``"cache"``.

    """Resolve a Hugging Face token following the documented chain.

    Resolution order, first hit wins:

    1. ``flag_token`` — typically the parsed ``--token`` CLI flag.
       Empty / whitespace-only strings are ignored (treated the same
       as "not passed") so a shell that expanded an empty variable
       doesn't silently produce an unauthenticated upload.
    2. ``$HF_TOKEN`` — recommended for CI and shell usage; same
       empty-string handling as the flag.
    3. ``<HF_HOME>/token`` (default ``~/.cache/huggingface/token``) —
       the file written by ``hf auth login``. Read fully, stripped of
       surrounding whitespace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flag_token:
        Value of the ``--token`` CLI flag, or ``None`` if not
        supplied. Whitespace-only values are treated as missing.
    env:
        Environment mapping, defaulting to ``os.environ``. Injectable
        for tests so they don't leak the real shell environment in.
    home:
        Override for the user home directory used to locate the
        cached-token file. Injectable for tests; production code
        should leave this ``None`` so the standard
        ``HF_HOME`` / ``$HOME`` resolution applies.

    Returns
    -------
    ResolvedToken
        The token plus a label for the source.

    Raises
    ------
    AuthError
        If none of the three sources yields a non-empty token. The
        message names the full resolution chain so the user has a
        clear remediation path.
