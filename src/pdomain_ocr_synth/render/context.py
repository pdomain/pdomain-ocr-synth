"""Per-render-run shared state: font cache + RNG.

A ``RenderContext`` is built once per render run (by the dataset
loop) and threaded into every per-sample call. Heavy state — opened
freetype faces, uharfbuzz faces — lives here so we don't reopen
the font for every sample.

Determinism contract (per ``docs/roadmap/05-rendering.md``): all
randomness flows from the recipe's ``seed`` through a single
``Random`` per render run, **branched per sample by sample index**.
Same recipe + seed + sample index → identical output bytes. The
loop is expected to call ``ctx.reseed_for_sample(i)`` before each
``render_word_crop`` call.
