"""Recipe search-path resolution.

A recipe argument on the CLI may be either a path or a name. Names are
resolved against the search path defined in ``docs/usage/recipe-workflow.md``:

1. ``$PD_OCR_SYNTH_RECIPES`` (colon-separated)
2. ``./recipes/`` relative to CWD
3. ``<package>/recipes/`` shipped with the install

For each entry, both ``<dir>/<name>.yaml`` and ``<dir>/<name>/recipe.yaml``
are recognized — the latter mirrors the layout produced by
``pdomain-ocr-synth init``.
