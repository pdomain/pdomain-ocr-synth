"""Pure-function line wrap-fitter for ``paragraphs`` / ``pages`` modes.

Spec 06 says:

    layout:
      mode: paragraphs
      max_width_px: 800
      ...

The wrap-fitter turns a free-form word stream + a pixel-width budget
into a ``list[str]`` of lines that each fit within the budget when
shaped end-to-end through HarfBuzz. Pure function over font metrics —
no rasterization, no canvas, no RNG.

Why measure-by-shaping (instead of e.g. summing per-glyph advances of
each word in isolation): cross-word context — kerning, contextual
alternates, even simple ASCII pairs like "Te" — can shrink or grow a
joined line's width vs. the sum of its parts. We shape the *candidate
line* (`" ".join(words_so_far + [word])`) on every trial so the budget
check matches what ``render_line`` will later actually paint.

Greedy first-fit. We don't do Knuth-Plass; that would give prettier
ragged-right margins but is overkill for synthetic OCR training data,
where any reasonable wrap that produces left-aligned line bboxes is
fine.

Long-word policy: if a single word's shaped width exceeds
``max_width_px``, the word is emitted alone on its own line — no
character-level breaking, no glyph splitting. The caller's downstream
``render_line`` / ``render_paragraph`` will still happily render an
oversized line; the only consequence is that the resulting line bbox
will exceed the recipe's wrap budget. Recipes with huge tokens and
tight budgets are a recipe-author bug, not a renderer concern.

Empty-input policy: empty / whitespace-only ``text`` returns ``[]``
rather than raising. Callers that need at least one line should check
for the empty result themselves — same convention as
``str.splitlines``.

    """Greedy wrap ``text`` into lines that each fit ``max_width_px``.

    Args:
        text: Free-form text. Words are split on contiguous-whitespace
            runs (same convention as ``render_line``'s per-word
            grouping). Embedded newlines are honored as **hard** line
            breaks: each newline-separated chunk wraps independently
            and the results are concatenated. This lets a paragraph
            corpus token that already carries line structure (e.g.
            poetry) keep its hard breaks while still wrapping any
            still-too-long chunks.
        max_width_px: Pixel budget per line. Must be positive.
        handles: Already-opened font handles for the chosen font, with
            ``ft_face`` already pixel-sized (caller responsibility).
            Only ``hb_face`` is used here — measurement runs through
            HarfBuzz alone.
        pixel_size: The pixel size HarfBuzz scales the font to. Same
            value the eventual ``render_line`` will use.
        features: Optional OpenType feature overrides, identical shape
            to what ``_shape`` accepts.
        first_line_indent_px: Pixels by which the **first** emitted
            line will be indented at paint time (see
            :func:`render_paragraph`'s ``first_line_indent_px``). The
            wrap-fitter shrinks the first line's budget to
            ``max_width_px - first_line_indent_px`` so the painted
            line — image strip + indent — still fits the user's
            requested wrap budget. Defaults to ``0`` (no shrink), which
            preserves the historical wrap output bit-for-bit. Must be
            non-negative; values that would zero or negate the first
            line's budget fall back to ``max_width_px`` so a single
            word still fits on line 0 (the renderer's long-word policy
            is to emit an over-budget word alone rather than refuse).

    Returns:
        A list of lines, each a non-empty string with no embedded
        whitespace runs collapsed (we preserve the original word
        spelling). Words within a line are joined by single ASCII
        spaces. Empty / whitespace-only input returns ``[]``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``max_width_px <= 0``, ``pixel_size <= 0``, or
            ``first_line_indent_px < 0``.
