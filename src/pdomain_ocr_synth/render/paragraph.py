"""Render a ``paragraphs``-mode sample.

A ``paragraphs`` sample is N lines stacked vertically with consistent
font, size, ink, and background — emitted as a single image whose
ground truth carries per-line and per-word bboxes plus the joined
paragraph text. Per spec 06:

    layout:
      mode: paragraphs
      max_width_px: 800
      max_lines: 8
      line_spacing: { min: 1.1, max: 1.5 }
      alignment: justify
      paragraph_indent_em: 0

This module implements the **paragraph compositing primitive only**.
The caller is expected to hand it a pre-fitted ``list[str]`` of lines
(one rendered line per element). The wrap-fitter that turns a free-
form word stream into a fitted line list lands in a separate M09
chunk; same for ``alignment`` and ``paragraph_indent_em``, which
require the wrap-fitter to be meaningful.

What this primitive *does* enforce:

- Font, size, dpi, ink, and background are sampled **once** per
  paragraph and reused for every line. (Mixing fonts mid-paragraph
  would be a deliberate stylistic choice, not the default; if a
  recipe ever wants it, it's a follow-up.)
- ``layout.line_spacing`` (a recipe scalar / range / weighted choice
  with a unit of "× the font's nominal line height") drives the
  vertical advance between baselines. Sampled once per paragraph so
  spacing is uniform within the sample.
- Per-line bboxes are computed from the inked region of each line,
  shifted into the paragraph canvas's coordinate frame.
- Per-word bboxes are computed per line via the same cluster→word
  mapping as ``render_line``, then shifted into the paragraph frame
  and concatenated in reading order.

The returned :class:`RenderedSample` has:

- ``text`` = ``"\\n".join(lines)`` — the paragraph as a single string,
  with each input line on its own line. Newlines in input lines are
  rejected (they'd confuse the cluster→word mapping).
- ``image`` = a single tight-cropped paragraph image with per-side
  padding sampled from ``layout.padding_px``.
- ``glyph_runs`` = per-cluster bboxes from every line, concatenated
  in reading order, all shifted into the paragraph frame.
- ``word_boxes`` = per-word text + tight bbox, in reading order
  (line 0 left-to-right, then line 1, etc.).
- ``line_boxes`` = per-line text + tight bbox, in input order.

Raises :class:`MissingGlyphError` if the chosen font lacks any
non-whitespace codepoint across the union of input lines (line-by-
line raise would be wasteful: skipping a font for one paragraph is
a paragraph-wide decision).

    See module docstring for the full contract.

    If ``presampled`` is provided, the renderer skips its internal
    RNG-driven style sampling and reuses those values. This is how
    the M09 wrap-fitter call site (``run_recipe`` paragraphs dispatch)
    keeps the wrap budget aligned with what the renderer paints —
    the same font + pixel size measured by ``fit_lines`` is the one
    used here. Direct callers (tests, the preview UI) can omit the
    kwarg and get the historical behavior.

    ``first_line_indent_px`` shifts the **first** line of the
    paragraph horizontally to the right by that many pixels. Used by
    :func:`render_page` to apply the recipe's
    ``layout.paragraph_indent_px`` per-paragraph (paragraphs-mode
    callers should leave this at the default ``0`` — the recipe
    validator already warns ``layout_key_unused`` if the field is set
    on a non-pages mode). The first line's image strip, per-cluster
    boxes, per-word boxes, and per-line bbox all shift by
    ``first_line_indent_px``; the canvas width grows to fit. Other
    lines are unaffected. ``0`` is a no-op (bit-identical to the
    historical render).

    ``recipe.layout.paragraph_alignment`` controls horizontal
    alignment of each line within the paragraph's natural width
    (``max(line_width + line_indent)`` over all lines). ``None`` and
    ``"left"`` are no-ops (bit-identical to the historical render);
    ``"center"`` centers each line's image, glyph runs, word boxes,
    and line bbox by the same per-line offset
    ``(paragraph_width - line_natural_width) // 2``; ``"right"``
    flushes each line to the right edge of ``paragraph_width`` with
    the per-line offset ``paragraph_width - line_natural_width``.
    Lines that are already as wide as the paragraph (the longest
    line, by construction) get a zero offset under both ``"center"``
    and ``"right"``. ``"justify"`` distributes the per-line slack
    (``paragraph_width - line_natural_width``) across the inter-word
    gaps in each line so the line's right edge is flush with
    ``paragraph_width``; per standard book-typesetting practice, the
    last line of the paragraph and any single-word lines fall back
    to left-alignment.

    Raises:
