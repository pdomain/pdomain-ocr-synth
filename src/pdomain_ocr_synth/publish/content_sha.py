"""Content-SHA digest over a built HF staging directory.

Per ``docs/specs/10-publishing.md`` § Idempotency and the matching
deliverable in ``docs/roadmap/08-publishing-hf.md``:

> Compute a content SHA over the staging directory (sorted file list +
> per-file SHA-256). Persist it as ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` in the
> dataset card front matter.

The SHA closes the idempotency loop: ``publish`` reads the latest HF
commit's ``card_data.pdomain-ocr-content-sha``; if it matches the freshly
computed digest, nothing has changed and the publish exits 0 with "no
changes" without creating a commit. ``--dry-run`` prints the same
digest so a caller can preview whether a re-run would be a no-op.

Two pieces live here, both pure file-IO (no network, no HF SDK):

1. :func:`compute_content_sha` — given a built staging directory,
   produce a deterministic 64-char hex digest.
2. :func:`apply_content_sha_to_readme` — rewrite
   ``<staging>/README.md`` so its front matter carries
   ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha: <digest>``. The dataset-card writer in
   ``dataset_card.py`` deliberately omits this key (see its module
   docstring): the SHA is computed *over* the staging dir contents
   (which include the README), so it must be inserted *after* the
   rest of the staging build has settled.

## Determinism contract

The digest must be invariant across:

- **Filesystem walk order.** We sort relative paths byte-wise (POSIX
  separator) before hashing, so any two filesystems / OSes produce
  the same digest for the same logical content.
- **Pre-existing ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` in README.md.** The README is
  hashed as it sits on disk, but ``apply_content_sha_to_readme``
  always strips any old ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` line before inserting
  the new one — see :func:`apply_content_sha_to_readme` for why this
  matters and how round-trips stay stable.

The digest must change for *any* logical change to the dataset:

- Image bytes added, removed, or modified.
- ``metadata.jsonl`` row text or column changes.
- ``recipe.snapshot.yaml`` byte-level changes.
- README body / front-matter changes (excluding the
  ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` line itself, which is intentionally part of
  the strip-and-replace cycle).

What we *don't* hash:

- File mode, mtime, owner — content only.
- Empty / hidden directories — only files contribute.

We do hash filenames: a file rename is a real content change and
should produce a new digest.

def compute_content_sha(staging_dir: Path) -> str:
    """Compute the content SHA over a built staging directory.

    Walks every file under ``staging_dir`` recursively, hashes each
    file's bytes with SHA-256, and returns the SHA-256 of the sorted
    ``"<relpath>\\n<file_sha>\\n"`` lines. The two-level structure
    (per-file SHAs feeding into a top-level SHA) means a callers can,
    in future, expose the per-file SHAs for sub-tree comparisons
    without changing the top-level digest.

    Path normalization:

    - Relative paths are POSIX-style (``data/0000000.png``) regardless
      of host OS, so digests are portable across Linux / macOS /
      Windows render hosts.
    - Sorting is byte-wise on the POSIX form. ASCII filenames sort
      identically to lexicographic; non-ASCII metadata names (we don't
      currently emit any) would sort by UTF-8 byte order.

    Idempotency w.r.t. the embedded SHA line: when the staging README
    already carries a ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha:`` front-matter line (e.g.
    after :func:`apply_content_sha_to_readme` has run), that line is
    stripped before the README is hashed. This makes the digest
    invariant across the apply-then-recompute cycle the upload
    orchestrator relies on:

        digest1 = compute_content_sha(staging)        # before embed
        apply_content_sha_to_readme(staging, digest1) # writes line
        digest2 = compute_content_sha(staging)        # after embed
        assert digest1 == digest2

    Without this strip, the post-apply README bytes differ from the
    pre-apply ones and the orchestrator would never see ``UP_TO_DATE``
    on a re-publish.

    Parameters
    ----------
    staging_dir:
        Built staging directory. Must exist; need not yet have a
        README, but typically does (call this *after*
        ``build_recognition_staging``).

    Returns:
    -------
    str
        Lower-case hex digest, 64 characters.

    Raises:
    ------
    ContentShaError
        If ``staging_dir`` doesn't exist or isn't a directory.

def apply_content_sha_to_readme(staging_dir: Path, content_sha: str) -> Path:
    """Insert ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` into the staging README's front matter.

    Strips any pre-existing ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha:`` line before
    inserting the new value. This makes the operation idempotent:
    calling it twice with the same SHA leaves the README byte-for-byte
    unchanged, and calling it twice with different SHAs leaves only
    the latest value (no stale duplicates).

    Why we strip-and-rewrite rather than recompute the digest with the
    old line included: a publish workflow conceptually computes the
    SHA *over the staging dir as it would be uploaded*. Once the SHA
    is in the README, hashing again with that line would change the
    digest. The stable convention is "hash the staging dir with no
    ``pdomain-ocr-content-sha`` line in the README, then write that digest
    in" — :func:`compute_content_sha` is called *before* this helper.

    The insertion point is right after the last ``pdomain-ocr-*`` key in
    the front matter so the conventional keys stay grouped. If no
    front matter is found, one is created.

    Parameters
    ----------
    staging_dir:
        Directory containing the README to rewrite.
    content_sha:
        The hex digest to record. Stored verbatim; callers should
        pass the output of :func:`compute_content_sha`.

    Returns:
    -------
    Path
        The README path that was rewritten.

    Raises:
    ------
    ContentShaError
        If ``<staging_dir>/README.md`` doesn't exist. The publish
        flow always builds the staging dir (which writes a README)
        before calling this; the missing-README case indicates a
        programmer-side ordering bug worth surfacing.
