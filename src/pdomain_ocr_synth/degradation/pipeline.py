"""Stage protocol and pipeline runner.

A degradation pipeline is an ordered list of stages. Each stage is
applied with its declared probability; if the dice roll says skip,
the sample passes through unmodified. Order matters:

    geometric → optical → paper → noise → JPEG

(per ``docs/specs/07-degradation.md``). The runner does not enforce
this order; the recipe author is responsible. Tests guard against
reorderings that would obviously break output (see ``test_degradation``).

There are two flavors of stage:

- **Pixel-only** (``Stage`` protocol). The vast majority. Takes a
  ``PIL.Image`` plus the stage's options dict and the per-sample RNG
  and returns a new image. The bbox / glyph_runs do not change.
- **Geometry-aware** (``GeometryStage`` protocol). Used by stages that
  rotate, warp, or otherwise move pixels relative to the bbox (e.g.
  ``skew``). Takes the whole ``RenderedSample`` so the stage can
  update bbox + glyph_runs alongside the image.

Both protocols are registered into the same ``REGISTRY`` dict by kind.
The runner inspects the registry entry's signature shape to decide
which call form to use; we tag each entry explicitly to keep the
dispatch trivial.
