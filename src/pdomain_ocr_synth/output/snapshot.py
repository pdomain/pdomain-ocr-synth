"""``recipe.snapshot.yaml`` writer + comparator.

Per ``docs/architecture/output-and-publishing.md``: the snapshot is the resolved
recipe written next to the output. It carries:

- absolute paths (the loader already does this; we round-trip the
  pydantic ``model_dump``)
- expanded presets (the loader already inlines these)
- the running tool version + the seed actually used at render time
- a SHA-256 of every font + local-corpus file at render time

The snapshot is what ``--resume`` checks against to detect "the recipe
or its inputs changed since the previous run; refusing to keep
appending samples that no longer match." Snapshot equality is by-value
on the resolved recipe dict (modulo ``count``, which can grow on
resume) plus per-input file hashes.
