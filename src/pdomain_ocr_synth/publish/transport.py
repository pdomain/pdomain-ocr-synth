"""Transport interface for the Hugging Face publish step (M08).

Per ``docs/specs/10-publishing.md`` § Tooling used, the upload path
needs five primitive operations:

1. ``HfApi.create_repo`` — first-time repo creation.
2. ``HfApi.upload_large_folder`` — chunked, resumable folder upload.
3. ``HfApi.list_repo_commits`` — read the latest commit's ``card_data``
   for the idempotency check.
4. ``HfApi.create_tag`` — optional ``--tag`` after upload.
5. ``HfApi.repo_info`` (or equivalent) — does the repo exist at all?

Rather than wire ``huggingface_hub`` directly into the CLI runner, we
hide those calls behind a Protocol. Two motivations:

- **Offline tests.** Every M08 deliverable that follows this seam
  (idempotency check, upload commit-message format, exit-code mapping
  for auth + network failures) needs to be testable without a real HF
  token or network. A fake transport makes all of that hermetic.
- **Single import boundary for the SDK.** Once the concrete
  :class:`HfHubTransport` adapter lands in a later chunk, it will be
  the *only* file that imports ``huggingface_hub``. The CLI runner
  stays SDK-agnostic and can be exercised under fakes in unit tests
  while the adapter is exercised under SDK mocks in its own tests.

This module is **pure typing + a fake double**; no SDK import here.
The concrete adapter lands in a later chunk along with the upload
orchestrator.

## What's *not* on the Protocol

We deliberately do not expose:

- File-level upload (``upload_file``). The upload story is folder-at-
  a-time per the spec; a file-level method would invite ad-hoc usage
  that bypasses the resumable chunking.
- Authentication wiring. The ``token`` is supplied at transport
  construction time, not per-call — that's the contract
  ``huggingface_hub.HfApi(token=...)`` already follows and it keeps
  call-sites short.
- Branch / refs management. The spec is silent on multi-branch
  publishes; we publish to ``main`` and never elsewhere.

Adding any of those is fine when a milestone calls for it; the
Protocol is intentionally narrow so a future addition is a deliberate
extension rather than a slow drift.
