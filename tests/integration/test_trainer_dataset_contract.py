"""Cross-project contract tests against ``pd-ocr-trainer`` readers.

This is the M09 residual: locks the contract that ``pdomain-ocr-synth``'s
recognition + detection writer outputs are loadable by the readers
``pd-ocr-trainer`` actually drives — `doctr.datasets.RecognitionDataset`
and `doctr.datasets.DetectionDataset` (the trainer wires both directly,
see ``pd_ocr_trainer/train_recog.py`` and ``train_detect.py``).

Two layers
----------

1. **Always-on shape contract tests.** ``doctr`` isn't a runtime dep
   of pdomain-ocr-synth (and shouldn't be — synth produces, doesn't read).
   So we re-implement the *exact* shape checks the doctr readers do,
   as plain ``json.load + assertions``, against tiny synthetic
   outputs we build in-process. These run under ``make ci`` on every
   commit and catch ``labels.json`` schema drift the moment it
   happens. The shape predicates are inlined from
   ``doctr/datasets/recognition.py`` and ``doctr/datasets/detection.py``
   v1.x as of 2026-05; if doctr changes its reader contract, this
   file is the first place to update.

2. **Opt-in live integration tests.** Gated on
   ``PD_OCR_SYNTH_TRAINER_E2E=1``. These import
   ``doctr.datasets.RecognitionDataset`` / ``DetectionDataset``
   directly and feed them the synthetic output. Skipped under default
   ``make ci`` (doctr isn't installed in synth's env), and on
   developer machines where the trainer's venv is reachable they
   provide the strongest possible drift signal: the actual
   trainer-side reader instantiates without error and yields the
   expected sample count.

Env-var contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``PD_OCR_SYNTH_TRAINER_E2E``
    Master switch. Truthy enables the integration tests. The test
    *also* requires ``doctr`` to be importable; we treat
    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` as a skip rather than a failure so a
    misconfigured env doesn't look like the test broke.

Convention follows ``tests/integration/test_publish_live_hf.py``
(M08): ``tests/integration/`` for opt-in tests, ``@pytest.mark.integration``,
``pytest.mark.skipif`` gating, always-on sanity tests for the gating
helpers.
