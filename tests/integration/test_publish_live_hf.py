"""Live end-to-end Hugging Face publish test (M08, opt-in).

This is the real-network counterpart to the in-process publish-flow
tests in ``tests/test_publish_orchestrator.py`` and
``tests/test_cli_publish_upload.py``. It exercises the **production**
code path:

    build_recognition_staging
        → publish_recognition(transport=make_default_transport(token))
        → assert (created | uploaded), README has pdomain-ocr-* keys
        → publish_recognition again
        → assert NO_CHANGE (idempotent no-op)
        → finally: HfApi.delete_repo (cleanup)

Tracked under "Residual M08 work → End-to-end live HF test" in
``docs/roadmap/08-publishing-hf.md``. The corresponding spec entry is
``docs/specs/10-publishing.md`` § Tests ("End-to-end test against a
private 'scratch' repo on HF (gated by an HF_TOKEN env var; skipped on
CI without secrets)").

How to run
----------
The default ``make ci`` (and any plain ``pytest`` invocation) skips
this test. To run it live::

    export PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E=1
    export HF_TOKEN=hf_...                      # write scope on the namespace
    # optional — overrides the default repo name:
    export PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E_REPO=me/pdomain-ocr-synth-livetest-recognition
    uv run pytest -m integration tests/integration/test_publish_live_hf.py -v

Env-var contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E``
    Master switch. Anything truthy (``"1"``, ``"true"``, etc.) enables
    the test. Unset / empty / ``"0"`` skips. Name matches the spec's
    "gated by an env var" requirement and is namespaced so a sibling
    pd-* repo can reuse the same ``HF_TOKEN`` without colliding.
``HF_TOKEN``
    Required. The token must have **write** scope on the namespace
    used by ``PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E_REPO``. Resolved via the standard
    publish auth chain (``--token`` > ``HF_TOKEN`` >
    ``~/.cache/huggingface/token``); we only support the env-var slot
    here because there's no CLI flag in a pytest invocation.
``PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E_REPO``
    Optional. Canonical ``OWNER/NAME`` for the scratch dataset repo.
    Default: ``pdomain/pdomain-ocr-synth-livetest-recognition``.
    The test creates and **deletes** this repo each run, so point it
    at a throwaway namespace.

Convention for future live tests
--------------------------------
Place opt-in tests under ``tests/integration/``. Mark them with
``@pytest.mark.integration`` and gate with::

    @pytest.mark.skipif(
        not _live_enabled(),
        reason="set PD_OCR_SYNTH_HF_E2E=1 + HF_TOKEN to run live",
    )

so they collect cleanly under ``make ci`` (visible as skips, not
errors). The env-var prefix ``PD_OCR_SYNTH_<SUITE>_…`` keeps each
opt-in suite self-contained.
