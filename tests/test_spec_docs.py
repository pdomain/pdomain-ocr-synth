"""Spec-doc ↔ implementation drift guards.

Each test in this module pairs a claim made in ``docs/specs/`` with
the source-of-truth in ``src/pdomain_ocr_synth/`` and fails if the two get
out of sync. The pattern mirrors the degradation-kind catalog meta-
tests in ``test_validation.py`` (iter 66).

Why this file exists. The spec docs are the contract this project is
implemented against, and a stale doc is a real bug — downstream
trainers, recipe authors, and contributors all read the spec to
discover field names, file names, exit codes, etc. When the code
moves but the doc lags, the contract silently fragments. Iter 25
caught the original ``pages.json``/``labels.json`` rename in spec 08;
iter N (this commit) catches a follow-on case where spec 06 and spec
10 were still calling the detection labels file by its old name even
though the writer + reader had moved on.

Each test reads the spec markdown verbatim — no parsing of canonical
data structures we control — so the test only passes when the doc
text on disk genuinely names the right artifact.

# Spec 06 "Font selection" validator table ↔ ``_check_fonts`` (this iter)
#
# Earlier drafts of spec 06 made three claims about the validator:
#
#   "The validator inspects each font and reports:
#    - The set of codepoints covered
#    - Codepoints in the corpus that the font does not cover
#    - Whether ``liga``/``calt`` features are present"
#
# None of these were true. ``_check_fonts`` only emits ``font_missing``,
# ``optional_font_missing``, ``font_unreadable``, and ``font_empty``;
# coverage is checked at *render* time via ``MissingGlyphError``, and
# no GSUB-feature inspection exists at all (``freetype-py`` doesn't
# expose GSUB and we don't pull ``fonttools``). Recipe authors reading
# the spec would expect a pre-render coverage report and silent-drop
# warnings on missing OT features — neither was implemented.
#
# Spec 06 now documents the actual validator surface as a table:
#
#     | Code | When |
#     |------|------|
#     | `font_missing` (error) | ... |
#     | `optional_font_missing` (warning) | ... |
#     | `font_unreadable` (error) | ... |
#     | `font_empty` (error) | ... |
#
# This guard parses that table and asserts it equals the set of
# font-related codes the validator actually emits, in both directions:
#   - ``spec_only`` — codes documented but not in ``VALIDATION_CODES``
#     (stale doc claim).
#   - ``code_only`` — font-prefixed codes registered but missing from
#     the spec table (silent-ship).
#
# Same precedent as iter-83 (spec-07 ``ink_thin`` table) and the
# spec-01 ``VALIDATION_CODES`` drift guard above.

# Spec 04 has one ``## `<type>` `` heading per documented provider
# (``local``, ``web``, ``web_list``, ``wikisource``, ``hf_dataset``,
# ``internet_archive``, ``gutenberg``). The recipe model declares a

# the M03 builtins; a recipe whose ``type`` model-validates but isn't
# registered crashes at render with ``ProviderError``.

# either (a) registered with the runtime registry, or (b) explicitly
# tracked as deferred in the M03 roadmap. Without this guard, spec 04
# could quietly accumulate "documented but not implemented" entries
# that never get flagged anywhere.

# Spec 04 ↔ pydantic per-provider field parity (this iter)
#
# Iter 96 fixed one slice of this drift: ``WebCorpus.field_path`` was
# documented in spec 04 (``parser: json`` example shows the
# ``field_path:`` key) but missing from the pydantic model, so
# pydantic's ``extra='forbid'`` rejected it at YAML load — making the
# documented option unreachable from any recipe. The recommended
# follow-up was a structural meta-test that walks every provider's
# documented options and asserts the matching pydantic model accepts
# them. This is that meta-test.
#
# Method:
#   - Parse spec 04 by walking each ``## `<provider>``` section and
#     pulling option keys from (a) the per-provider YAML examples and
#     (b) the leading "Common keys" table that applies across all
#     providers.
#   - Build the model-side surface from the union member's
#     ``model_fields`` plus an explicit allow-list of runtime-only
#     keys that intentionally never reach the model (e.g. ``urls`` on
#     ``web_list`` — that provider is roadmap-deferred, has no
#     pydantic model, and the spec lists keys we'll need when it
#     ships).
#   - Assert ``provider_keys_in_spec ⊆ model_field_names ∪  # noqa: RUF003
#     ALLOWED_RUNTIME_KEYS``. A key in the spec but missing from both
#     is real drift — exactly the iter-96 bug class.
#
# When the meta-test surfaces drift, the fix is the iter-96 pattern:
# add the field to the model, regenerate ``docs/specs/recipe.schema.json``
# via ``make schema``, and add a load-path test in
# ``tests/test_recipe_loader.py`` that pins the round-trip. Update
# the allow-list only when the missing key is genuinely runtime-only

# models in ``pdomain_ocr_synth.recipe.models`` are the source-of-truth that
# decides whether a key loads. ``extra="forbid"`` on the frozen base
# rejects unknown keys, so any key spec 02 advertises that the model
# doesn't declare would *fail loudly at load time* — not silently.
# That's better than silent drift, but it's still a dishonest doc:
# users following spec 02 verbatim hit a ValidationError instead of the
# documented behaviour. (Iter 77 catalogued this whole class of drift;
# this guard locks it down for spec 02.)
#
# Every fenced ``yaml`` block in spec 02 is parsed and its keys checked
# against the appropriate model:
#
#   - the top-level overview block lists every ``Recipe`` field, so each
#     of its keys must be in ``Recipe.model_fields``;
#   - each per-block example (``output:``, ``rendering:``, ``layout:``,
#     ``publish:``) has its inner keys checked against the matching
#     block model;
#   - per-entry list examples (``corpus:``, ``fonts:``, ``degradation:``,
#     ``text_transforms:``) iterate the example entries and check the
#     keys of each against the appropriate model — the corpus union is
#     dispatched on ``type``.
#
# Goal: any future spec 02 example that mentions a key not on the model
# (typo, half-finished feature, copy-paste from a spec stuck in roadmap)
# fails this test instead of waiting for a recipe author to trip on it.

# Spec 02 ``## Validation rules (summary)`` ↔ ``validate_recipe`` (iter 88)
#
# Spec 02's "Validation rules" section is the user-facing contract for
# what ``pdomain-ocr-synth validate`` enforces. Iter 87 caught spec 06
# making a render-time check sound like a validate-time check; this
# meta-test catches the same drift sub-class in spec 02. Two specific
# stale claims tripped the audit:
#
#   - Pre-fix line 145 said ``validate`` produces a "sample report" of
#     "codepoints needed by the post-transform corpus". Per-codepoint
#     coverage at validate time is deferred (acknowledged in
#     ``docs/specs/fonts-gaelic.md``); no sample report is emitted.
#   - Pre-fix rule 5 said ``validate`` checks corpus reachability
#     "or" cache presence under ``--offline``. Neither check runs at
#     validate time — the ``offline`` parameter on ``validate_recipe``
#     is a documented placeholder (``_ = offline  # placeholder for
#     M03 wiring``). The real ``--offline`` enforcement happens at
#     fetch time in ``corpus.runner`` via ``OfflineCacheMissError``.
#
# We lock the corrected wording in place by asserting:
#   1. The render-time deferral is acknowledged in spec 02 (so a
#      future edit can't quietly re-introduce the "sample report"
#      claim without simultaneously implementing it).
#   2. Validate-time reachability claims are absent (so an editor
#      can't restore the "Corpus providers can be reached…" bullet
#      without first wiring the check).
#   3. ``--offline`` is documented as a fetch-time / runtime contract,
#      not a validate-time one.
#
# When the implementation eventually grows a real per-codepoint
# coverage report or per-entry cache-presence check at validate time,
# the developer should land both the code AND the spec edit in the
# same change; this guard will then need an update to match the new
# honest wording.
